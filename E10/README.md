We can get the total number of unique cubes, by adding the unique cubes for each combination of blue and yellow. i.e. 8 blue, 7 blue 1 yellow, 6 blue 2 yellow, etc...
By symmetry, the number of unique cubes in a 7 blue 1 yellow will mirror that of 1 blue 7 yellow, so we only need to consider one.
This makes our total number of unique cubes will be as follows:
2 * (8 blue) + 2 * (7 blue 1 yellow) + 2 * (6 blue 2 yellow) + 2 * (5 blue 3 yellow) + 1 * (4 blue 4 yellow)

The number of unique cubes in an 8 blue combination is 1.

The number of unique cubes in a 7 blue 1 yellow combination is also 1. 

The number of unique cubes in a 6 blue 2 yellow combination is 3.

5 blue 3 yellow

4 blue 4 yellow
