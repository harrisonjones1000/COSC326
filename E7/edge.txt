In general, I don't think the verbs go, read and learn can be applied to people.

I went you * 
I made you 
I wanted you
I saw you
I called you
I asked you
I read you * 
I learnt you *

all of these are valid.

In subject:object sentences, the subject and object cannot intersect.

You made you
You wanted you
You saw you
You called you
You asked you
You read you

all of these are valid

Clarify 

We (3 excl) go  v.s. We (3 excl) are going

both are valid and should be present tense

---

E7 is really stupid.

---

I am going
I going
I go (should this be future of present?) (assume present)

We are going
We going
We go
