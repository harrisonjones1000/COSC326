In general, I don't think the verbs go, read and learn can be applied to people.

I went you * 
I made you 
I wanted you
I saw you
I called you
I asked you
I read you * 
I learnt you *

In subject:object sentences, the subject and object cannot intersect.

You made you
You wanted you
You saw you
You called you
You asked you
You read you
