L - ArrayList of Point2D objects, sorted by x

We need to select a slice from the minimum x threshold to the maximum x threshold.

1. Find the index of the point with the smalled x value that is greater than the min threshold.
2. Find the index of the point with the largest x value that is less than the max threshold.
3. Slice list from minObj to maxObj.
4. for each object in slice, if obj.y is > yMin && obj.y < yMax, append to new list.
5. New list has all points to consider.


New Idea:

Use the "box" method recursively (perhaps with a circle instead of a box)

Pick the first point and a starting radius
Calculate the number of points in a box around the point (box has radius r)
if box has fewer then 12 points, double r and try again.

Then

Pick a point
Build a box around that point and count the points
If there are more than 12 points
For each of these points:
 Compute box around point with reduced radius.
If there are fewer than 12 points:
 Look at your last radius that had more than equal to 12.
